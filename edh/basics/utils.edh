# %%
# `desc()` `show()` as well as the `repr()` familiar from Python, and etc.
# are utility procedures from the default batteries, hover on refs to them
# below, to see their doc as tooltip, or go to / peek their respective
# (meta) definition as you like:
desc show repr str
# Note they are implemented as host procedures, the `batteries/meta` module
# set just presents meta documentation for them.

# %% Run this cell
show( console )
# %% And the equivalent
show$ console
# Make yourself comfortable with the Haskell style syntax,
# that should be considered more idiomatic in ƒê codebases.
