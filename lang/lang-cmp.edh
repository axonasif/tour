{## Target Audience
 # - For developers familiar with some other Object-Oriented, dynamic scripting language

If you are familiar with any other Object-Oriented, dynamic, scripting language, like Python, JavaScript, Smalltalk etc, this is for you. You just need to know the differences and a few important gotchas, could save you a great deal of time going over some basic concepts.

Familiarity with Haskell is a great plus, as the base Đ interpreter is written in Haskell, and many Đ language constructs are influenced by Haskell.

  import * './grammar'
  edh'grammar'details # <- follow this bookmark to there

  # Alternatively, you can learn Python first if you prefer.
}


{## Overview
 # - General reason of most design choices

The Đ grammar is designed with a major goal of interoperation by scripting, for IPC (Inter-Process Communication) across processes of heterogeneous runtime implementations. So as to finally integrate massive scale of software compoonents (possibly independently developed by many vendors) into live systems.

While some constructs from Haskell, Go, Python and others, are introduced
for purpose of ergonomics. E.g.

- custom infix operators, with arbitrary associativity and precedence
    * from Haskell, C++ etc.

- pattern matching & branching
    * from typical FP languages, as well as upcoming PEP-634 of Python

- goroutine
    * from Go

- compositional object
    * sorta from Go type embedding, and C++ multiple-inheritance

- class based inheritance
    * from Python, Smalltalk etc.

- C3 linearized multiple inheritance
    * from Python, which is in turn from Dylan

- magic object methods
    * from Python

- data classes
    * from Python PEP-557

- prototype based inheritance
    * from JavaScript

- fat-arrow procedure (lambda)
    * from JavaScript, while the lambda aspect from all multi-paradigm languages with FP in mind, including JavaScript and Python

- symbols
    * from JavaScript, yet much enhanced

{## Format-on-Save
 # - There is an official code formatter for Đ

You may already know what an opinionated code formatter is, such as Black for Python, Prettier for JavaScript (and HTML, CSS etc.), an Ormolu for Haskell:
  https://black.readthedocs.io
  https://prettier.io
  https://github.com/tweag/ormolu

So it should be no surprise to you, that Đ comes with its own formatter, yet officially:
  https://github.com/e-wrks/edh-vscode-formatter
  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ComplYue.edh-vscode-formatter

And note that Đ formatter is by default invoked on saving of `.edh` source files, Go tooling works this way, while other mainstream languages don't.

 #} {;

  # Home page of the formatter should have described the rules and your rights (freedom) well,  after modification, save or right-click to select "Format Document", then you'll see what the formatter thinks.

  # Hint: With VSCode, the default shortcut key for "Format Document", on macOS is Shift+Option+F and Ctrl+Shift+I on Linux

  # %% # try play with this cell:
  #    add/remove spaces, break it into multip lines, you name it

{## Optional Semicolons and Commas
 # - Semicolons and commas are technically optional

Just examples ought to be enough, plus guidelines for idiomatics:

 * Avoid semicolons - unless for disambiguation
 * Place trailing commas where possible - unless it's more concise without it

Note semicolons can be really technically omitted in Đ, not the case like in JavaScript, that the language does [Automatic Semicolon Insertion]

   # - However, you'd better be reminded of necessary disambiguations
   #} {;

    {## Disambiguate Unintended Indexing / Calling #}
    export edh'disambig'idx'call = bookmark()

    # Noticed the semicolons before each pair of square/round brackets? Why are they there?

    # The answer is: There usually need a semicolon before a pair of square/round brackets, when you don't mean to do indexing or calling against artifact before it.


    {## Disambiguate Block from Dict #}
    export edh'disambig'blk'dict = bookmark()

    # You may have noticed the semicolons everywhere, each following an opening curly brace too. Why are they there?

    # %% # Well, check out this:
    type( {; } )
    # %% # Then this:
    type( {} )
    # %#

    # The answer is: The semicolon inside `{;}` disambiguates it being a block (though empty) instead of an empty dict expressed as `{}`

    # FYI, in Đ, block is a type of expression (instead of statement as in C family languages). A block encloses arbitrary number of statements, and evaluates to the value of the last statement when executed (with the exception of branches' early break, though, and about that later)
    # %% # And an empty block evals to `nil`, check this to be true
    {; } is nil
    # %#

    # Though you don't need a semicolon when there is at least 1 statement in a block, e.g.
    # %% # This is a block with a single assignment expression statement
    { a=1 }
    # %% # But this is the idiomatic form, which is preferable for foolproof modifications in later code maintenance:
    {; a=1 }
    # %#

    # The idiomatic style is to put a semicolon right after the opening curly brace/bracket, when there are risks for it to be mis-interpreted/parsed as a dict literal:
    {;
      # It can still parse as dict literal with comments inside
    }


    # Finally, a comma to disambiguate ArgsPack (a super type of tuple like in Python), from parenthese-quoted single expression
    # %% # A single arguments pack
    ; ( 3*7, )
    # %% # A parenthese-quoted expression
    ; ( 3*7 )

    # %#

  }

}


{## Recommended Line Length
 # - It is under your control, well some advice here

For the record, Đ langauge support extension for VSCode sets the following config options per the language:

* Show rulers at column positions: 80, 100, 120
* Soft-wrap lines at 100, while adapting to narrower window width

You are recommended to hard-wrap source lines around column 80, and that's not for good old line printers set for Fortran punch cards, but to enable a human reader have 2~3 editor columns layed out on wide screens, to cross check code segments from multiple sites, without necessarity of tab switching, which is good for productivity.

For long paragraphs in comments, of mere documentation purpose, it's considered more idiomatic to keep them as long lines per each paragraph, so you don't need to manually maintain hard-wrap points when update documentation, just leave it soft-wrapped at 100 columns by default.

Nevertheless you can change per user settings of your IDE, for a different soft wrap strategy.

{## Common Parts with Pervasive Languages
 # - Đ has good interoperability with Python/JavaScript etc. at source level

Đ shares some common syntax with many popular programming languages (e.g. Python, JavaScript), in a nutshell:

 * Parentheses pair is the call-making operator
 * Expressions consist of named references, joined together by prefix/infix/postfix operators with certain precedence and fixity/associativity
 * Parentheses for precedence override

     # - Dedicated `import` and `export` keyword

  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules

You use explicit `export` keyword to decorate artifact definitions (e.g. assignments, procedure/class declarations), for them to be importable by other modules (or objects).

The `import` keyword is used to denote an import expression, the expression evaluates to the object resolved as the source for import, and with a side effect of artifacts exported from that object to be received into current scope, however specified by the arguments receiver part of the import expression.

  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html

Đ module files ends with `.edh` extension name, special cases include:

 * `__init__.edh` can stand for the import target as its parent directory, relative imports within it work more intuitively than a file module with its parent folder's name plus the `.edh` suffix.

 * `__main__.edh` stands for the entry module source file, when its parent directory is resolved as the entry module of an interpreter process.

Note that `__main__.edh` is the only valid entry module file name, unlike Python, otherwise named module file will never be run as an entry module.

About naming conventions, quoting:
  http://www.wellho.net/mouth/4611_Hungarian-Camel-Snake-and-Kebab-variable-naming-conventions.html

Camel case: numberOfPeople
A series of words, with each intermeidiate word started with a capital letter. Called "Camel Case" because the capital letters make it look like the humps of a camel.

Kebab case: number-of-people
Hypehated words - like chunks of meat or vegatables on a kebab skewer. Note that cannot case only works in a gew languahes such as Tcl and Perl 6, as the minus sign most usually is the subtraction operator.

Snake case: number_of_people
Words separated with underscores - the word snakes along past the underscores. Unlike Kebab case which is of limited (language) use, you can use Snake Case with most modern languages.

Hungarian (Systems) notation: iNumberOfPeople
In hungarian notation, you preceed the variable name with an additional character or characters to indicate the type of variable - in Hungarian Systems notation, that's an indiction of the internal data type such as i for Integer. You can see the developemnt of Hungarin Systems Notation from old Fortran conventions where variable names starting with I J K L M or N were integers, and others were floats.

Hungarian (Apps) notation: cntNumberOfPeople
Prefixing the name of the variable with character(s) to indicate the use make of a variable within the application - in my example, I have used cnt to incicate it's a counter ... and in my old Fortran programs you'll find "JPxxxxx" all over th eplace to indicate an integer pointer.

{## Terminology Differences
 # - Some similar things are named differently
 #} {;

  {## Procedure instead of Function
   # - There are procedures, but no function

A *function* in mathematics has well defined input and output, it can refer to nothing outside of its immutable input (though with enclosed implicit parameters included). Functional programming langauges e.g. Haskell, reflects such constraint well. But unfortunately many procedural / imperative programming langauges, tracing back to C and other ancestors, defined their "function"s with ability to access mutable global / closure "variable"s (The "variable" there is albeit another misconception agsinst mathematical variables), so side-effects can be there out of trivial reasonability by programmers in the day, leading to more bugs in software developed comercially.

It's not a big deal for Đ the language to have stopped refering to impure computations (with side-effects and mutable input) as "function"s, but more conforming conception is a good start to put effect tracking as a focus for the programming tools, looking forward for greater quality in the software developed as the result.

   #} {;
    {## Procedure instead of Function #}
    export edh'term'proc'stead'func = bookmark()
  }


  {## Attribute instead of Variable
   # - There are attributes, but no variable

There is no such a concept/term of "variable" in Đ. The "variable" concept in conventional programming languages is misleading or conflicting when you could possibly have mathematical concepts in the domain model of your business. More properly it should be called "assignable" as suggested in:
  https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2013/07/22/there-is-such-a-thing-as-a-declarative-language

Although attributes of entities in Đ are inherently meant to be assigned (as well as to be observed), they can not stand alone without a backing entity. Unlike in conventional programming languages, where a "variable" can be assigned individually.

   #} {;
    {## Attribute instead of Variable #}
    export edh'term'attr'stead'var = bookmark()
  }

}


{## Code Structure & Semantics
 # - Similar to Python, JavaScript, etc. but with subtle differences

Đ source code is organized as modules with respective source files, exporting artifacts for reuse, while importing artifacts from others, quite similar to Python codebases or JavaScript codebases consisting of ES6 modules.

Closure in Đ is more coarse grained - entire scopes, instead of individual "variable"s are enclosed. It makes Đ programs more potent to resource leaks, so more care should be taken by the programmer, to clear references to resource values as soon as not needed anymore.

 #} {;
  {## Code Structure & Semantics #}
  export edh'code'struct = bookmark()


  {## Name / Identifier
   # - The so called *variable identifier* or *variable name* elsewhere

All data in an Đ world is stored as attributes associated with certain entities under some names. Both objects and scopes are backed by entities, the naming mechnism works at the entity level, so stays the same for both objects and scopes.

   #} {;

      # Đ allows underscore (_) and the single-quote character (') in alphanumeric names, this is following Haskell, and more scientific naming friendly.

      edh'alphanum'names # <- follow this bookmark to the detailed secion in the grammar chapter

    }


    {## Symbolic Names
     # - Cross component encapsulation of implementation details

JavaScript introduced symbol, which is allowed as identifier of object properties:
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Symbol

Đ takes this idea further, gives it bigger purpose, and dedicated syntax.

Like other dynamic programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Đ objects (and scopes) are openly accessible, but with symbol key values eligible as symbolic attribute names, Đ programming interfaces can have multiple level of encapsulation ability, that even more flexible than what's supported by Java, C++ and similar languages.

Java has private/protected/public and the implicit package qualification to limit access to fields of a class, C++ has private/protected/public qualification plus friend declarations. In Đ, you define symbols to be used as the name of such fields (attributes of objects / scopes), then you can export the symbol key values differently than how the class (or namespace etc.) is exported. Other components can import these keys and use them to access such symbolic fields, as if they are public, or those fields will appear private/hidden to them. Different contracts with different sets of available symbols can be defined and exposed to different parties, for different levels of knowledge & access to the same codebase of implementation details.

     #} {;

    }


    {## Quaint Names
     # - Technically, any text can be used as attribute name

Special characters don't get in the way for you to use strings containing them as attribute identifiers. This comes handy in some cases, e.g. LSP (Language Server Protocol) service names tend to have slash `/` characters in it, but the Đ language server defines such service methods with verbatimly such names in the code.

  {## Scope and Call Stack
   # - Lexical (static) scoping & effect (dynamic) scoping

Lexical scoping rules of Đ are comparable to that of Python, JavaScript etc. but with gotchas.

Đ also does dynamic scoping for effect tracking, which is not done in similar languages.

    {## Lexical Attribute Resolution & Shadowing
     # - Similar to "variable" resolution in Python, JavaScript etc.

Direct attribute obtaining is very close to "variable" reading in similar languages, that inner scope attribute with the same name will shadow those live in outer scopes. But it is more dynamic in Đ - the attribute can be deleted from the inner scope, then your reads will immediately resolve to an outer attribute previously shadowed - this is not the case with either Python or JavaScript.

But you have no way to assign attributes into an outer scope (there are workarounds though), scoped assignments (not with dot-notation as target) will always go into current scope. There is neither `nonlocal` hints as in Python, nor explicit "variable" declaration (the `var` keyword) as in JavaScript. Prevalent dynamic namespace objects should be the norm in Đ code, to convey artifacts meant to be assigned by code run in inner scopes, via dot-notations.

     #} {;
      {## Lexical Attribute Resolution & Shadowing #}
      export edh'lexi'resolv = bookmark()

        # Upon entering a scoped block, a new lexical inner scope (backed by a separate entity) is created right away, then attributes can be defined locally. And an attribute present in an inner scope shadows all ones with the same name from outer scopes.

        console.print$ 'Inside, after local attr definition, x is: ' ++ x

      @}
      console.print$ 'Outside, x is: ' ++ x
      # %# Upon leaving a scoped block, all artifacts ever defined into the block scope are, discarded

      # Note the shadowing of samely named attributes from outer scopes is an anti-pattern, the code above is for demonstration purpose only and not idiomatic. Scoped blocks should be just used to discard its scope attributes upon leaving, it's discouraged to override attributes available from outer scopes like that.

    {## Effect Tracking by Dynamic Scoping
     # - A unique feature of Đ

Dynamic scoping - attribute resolution against the calling stack of caller frames - is seldom seen in modern programming languages anymore, but Đ is doing it for effect tracking, with solution to its historical problems.

  {## Namespaces
   # - Similar to TypeScript namespace

An Đ namespace is a special object defined with dedicated syntax. It's fairly norm to create namespaces ad-hoc during a procedure call, which carries more dynamic semantics, in addition to more "statically" define namespaces at top level of module initialization.

   #} {;
    {## Namespaces #}
    export edh'namespaces = bookmark()

    edh'namespaces # <- follow this bookmark for the detailed syntax and description in the grammar chapter

    # Alternative to Python `nonlocal` "variables", namespaces live in outer scope can hold attributes meant to be assigned by some code run in inner scopes.

    # Alternative to JavaScript hoisting, a procedure can be defined earlier to contain code wanting to call later defined other procedures.

  }


  {## Scoped Blocks
   # - A usual block doesn't create a nested scope, use special syntax to do that

Like in Python, JavaScript etc. a usual nested block of code doesn't create a nested scope to run.

You have to use a dedicated "function" in Python or JavaScript to create nested scopes, but Đ offers special syntax to do it easily.

   #} {;
    edh'scoped'blocks # <- follow this bookmark to the detailed description in the grammar chapter

    # %% # A scoped block is denoted by a pair of curly braces augmented with at (@) symbol, it evaluates to result of the last statement (usually an expression statement) in it

    y = nil # Let's clear `y` out of the REPL top scope for sure

    { # This starts a usual block

      x = 3 # This goes into the REPL top scope, as evaluated in a usual block

      {@ # This starts a scoped block

        y = 7 # This goes into the scope created by the scoped block

        x * y # This provides the result value for the whole scoped block, as last expression in it

      @} # This ends the scoped block. Note `y` is not in scope since here on

    } # This ends the usual block

    # %% # The nested scope created by a scoped block goes out after execution left that block
    x + y
    # %# See the error? `y` is not in scope here

  }

}


{## Coarse Grained Closure
 # - A procedure always captures the full lexical context where it is defined

As a consequence of the way attributes are resolved lexically, a procedure remembers the full hierarchy of its lexical outer scopes as in where it is defined. We say a procedure captures its enclosing context as a closure.

Note that Đ closure is rather coarse grained compared to many other programming languages, closures there usually capture individual "variables" accessible to them when defined, while in Đ it is actually the entities behind the lexical scopes get captured.

 #} {;
  {## Coarse Grained Closure #}
  export edh'closure = bookmark()

  # Such closure semantics is designed to allow dynamic evaluation/execution of Đ snippets anywhere anytime, honoring entities being integral units of information, without individual attributes teared apart.

  # But it may lead to unintentional resource leaks, especially if you've been used to closures in other mainstream programming languages.

  # TODO demonstrate gotchas of resource leaking due to the coarse grained closure.

{## Pattern Matching
 # - With syntax closer to Haskell than Python

 Đ pattern matching syntax is closer to that of Haskell rather than Python. And the syntax is actually not hard-coded by the language grammar, and can be customized with an alternative implementation of the branch (->) operator. The pattern syntax is no different than vanilla Đ expressions, just interpreted differently.

{## Object-Oriented, but Not Entirely
 # - Everything is a Value (instead of Object) in Đ

Everything is an Object in Python / Smalltalk, but although Đ is as *Object-Oriented* as Python, *NOT* everything is an object here, such as numbers, strings, and procedures. And there are a handful of special values.

Đ implements an object system with compositional Multiple-Inheritance with Multiple-Prototype Chains.
