{## Custom Message Channels
 # - Customize your message channels & perceivers

 Any object vending a `__perceive__` magic method can work like a message channel, but the semantics can be rather different than an ƒê message channel (e.g. thread terminating on `break` result), imagination is the only limitation for what you can do about his mechanism.

  {## A Demo Perceivable Chan #}
  class MyChan {

    {## Evaluate the perceiver body expression just inplace, and log it

This isn't actually working anything out, just to show technically, how such a magic method gonna to be invoked.

We make it an interpreter procedure so the caller's scope is available to us, then the perceiver body expression is evaluated as in there. It never has to be this way, a sophisticated message channel can even JIT compile the body expression and install the high-performance machine code somewhere.
     #}
    interpreter __perceive__( callerScope: scope, perceiverBodyExpr ) {

      let perceiverValue = callerScope.eval$ perceiverBodyExpr

      console.info<|'Start perceiving by: `' ++ show(perceiverValue) ++ '`'

    }

  }

  # %%
  cevs = MyChan()

  # %%
  perceive cevs console.print

  # %#

}
