{## Intuitable Syntax/Semantics/Pragramatics
 # - Even at cost of broken rules

ƒê is designed to be prevalently intuitable, i.e. capable of being intuitively sensed or understood. Also, the intuitions ought to be maintained for coherence.

Such goals should remain in extending the semantics & programatics by its users (lib authors and/or end programmers), even at cost of broken rules, those rules typical appear machine-friendly, in lexing, parsing, interpreting etc.
